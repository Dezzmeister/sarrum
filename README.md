# Å¡arrum

A React Native app to help learn Akkadian (Old Babylonian) as taught in John Huehnergard's _A Grammar of Akkadian_. Mobile implementation of [Akkadian Words (Windows)](https://github.com/Dezzmeister/akkadian-words).

## TODO

-   Practice feature for English and Akkadian words
-   Settings to allow user to control how many words appear in their dictionary
-   Cache the dictionary, only download if the user is online and if there is a new version
-   Practice feature for English and Akkadian phrases
-   Theming: add a light color theme where the beige and dark blue are reversed
-   (Maybe) make the AkkadianInput toolbar a keyboard input accessory that sticks to the top of the keyboard. Will require native code for Android
-   Continue adding vocab to dictionary, add features for new tenses and grammatical constructions as necessary
